#### DIV:

A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.

#### Attribute:

In HTML, an "attribute" is additional information that can be added to an HTML element to provide extra details about the element or to modify its behavior.

```bash
<tagname attribute_name="attribute_value">Content</tagname>

```

- <tagname> is the HTML element.
- attribute_name is the name of the attribute.
- attribute_value is the value assigned to the attribute.

```bash
<img src="kids.jpeg" alt="kids">
```

- <img> is the HTML element.
- src is the name of the attribute.
- kids.jpeg is the value assigned to the attribute.

Same goes with alt attribute.
