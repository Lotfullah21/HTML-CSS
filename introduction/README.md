### Network

When two devices connected together, they form a network.
<img src="./assets/internet/network.png" style="height:50px">

A network is made up of at least two devices that connect and communicate via a wired or wireless connection.

### Network Switch

It connects multiple devices together and allows them to communicate with each other.
One network switch can connect to another switch to link two networks.

### Interconnected network

When more network switches connected together, they are called interconnected network.

### Internet:

Interconnected network is called internet

### Server

A server is a computer that runs applications and provides services to the clients.
Users are called client in this terminology.

### Software

The codes that runs on a hardware like cpus are called software.

### Webserver

It handles web requests, data storage security and managing emails.
Web servers can handle thousands of requests from clients per second.

### Webpage:

A document that displays images, texts, videos and other contents.

### Website:

A collection of webpages that are linked together under one domain name.
It is more informative.

Websites can include static content, such as text, images, and videos, and they may also have interactive elements like forms or search bars.

##### Examples:

blogs, news websites, portfolio sites, and company websites.

`www.coursera.com`

### Web Application:

A web application, often referred to as a web app, is a dynamic and interactive software application that is accessed through a web browser.

Web applications often involve user input, data processing, and manipulation, and they may store user-specific data.
It offers:

- Personalized content for each user
- Dynamically updates the content for each user

##### Examples:

Email clients, social media platforms, online banking systems, and e-commerce sites.

One example could "amazon.com" where each has its own cart and shopping preference.

`www.coursera.com`

### Building Blocks:

There are three main building blocks for a webpage

- HTML: To structure the content.
- CSS: To add style to the content.
- JavaScript: To add functionality to the content, it is the powerhouse of the website.

#### HyperText Markup Language (HTML):

The way HTML describes the content is know as the markup.

##### Hypertext:

A text that contains links to other text

##### Markup:

Tags and elements that are used within a document.

##### tag(<></>):

a tag is a specific element used to define the structure and content of a web page.

#### Cascading Style Sheets:

It adds visual enhancement to the content.
It enhances the HTML elements and specifies how to display them.

### How it works:

When a user makes a request for a content, the content will be sent from a server to your computer and the browser translates that code into building blocks that user sees on the screen.
The above process is known as pages rendering.

### Web-browser:

A software application that is used to make a request to a server.

### Web-server:

A special kind of computer that allows other computers to make a request for data, in fact, it middle point between the database where the data is stored.
It process the users request gets the required data from a database and sends it back to the users machine.

### Application

It generates the dynamic content that will be sent to the user by web-server.
The application server generates the dynamic content that the web server sends back to the userâ€™s browser.

### Dynamic content:

It is generated while we use a website.

### Static content

These are the contents that are stored in the web server and will be delivered to the user as they are stored.

### HTTP:

A web server communicates with a web browser using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The content of most web pages is encoded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

### Internet Protocol

The date are exchanged in the from of messages which are also known as IP packets.

An IP packets contains the header and the payload(data)
IP header contains the source IP address (servers IP address) and destination IP address(users IP address)

### Open Source:

Source code is freely available to use for any one to build from.

### Library:

Libraries are pieces of reusable codes that a developer can use to perform certain actions in their application:
It helps us to focus more on the development of the application.
For instance, if we need to have users email as the login information, we do not need write the code from scratch to validate the email;Simply use a library that someone else has written
and save time.

`Requests ,Numpy,TensorFlow,PyTorch` in python, `Jquery,Bootstrap,Axios` for JavaScript are the examples of libraries.

### Framework:

It provides a pre-built structure for developers to built their application.

Frameworks dictate the overall structure and flow of an application and enforce certain design patterns and conventions.
A framework might use many libraries.

It defines the flow and control of your application.

Framework is just like a blue print or mould that we use to build our application from.

For instance `React, Angular` in JavaScript for frontend development, `Django,Express.js` in python and JavaScript for backend development and `Flask` for microservices.

### Advantages Of Framework:

- Saves time
- Gives a flow to our through out application development
- Helps us to use best practices

### Disadvantages Of Framework:

- Compatibility issues with the libraries outside of the framework
- Dependence on the libraries that are used inside the framework

#### Package Manager:

A tool that automatically download and install dependencies.

"download" involves transferring files from a remote location to a local device, while "install" involves setting up and configuring the downloaded software on the local device to make it usable. Downloading is the initial step to obtain the necessary files, while installing is the subsequent step to set up the software for use.

We use `Node package manager (NPM)` for managing our dependencies in front-end development.

#### Bundling:

The process of adding all dependencies inside a file in html file is known as bundling.
famous ones are `Webpack` and `Gulp`.

###### Refactoring:

Changing the structure of the code without changing its functionality.
