## Flex:

flex box is a type of container that and can easily scale over larger web applications and also it gives more control for controlling the elements inside a container.

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.(1)
