## Flex:

flex box is a type of container that and can easily scale over larger web applications and also it gives more control for controlling the elements inside a container.

The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.(1)

Because, The elements inside can grow, shrink unlike the block and inline block elements which does not have much control over the elements inside.

Flex box is a single-dimensional, which we means we can either align it along the vertical or horizontal axis.

When the elements are aligned along the rows, the horizontal-axis is called the main axis and vertical axis is called cross-axis.

If the row is the main axis, the items start from top left and continues until there is no space and starts in a new row once reached to the end of the first row.

# Flex Box Properties

width="360" height="120">

### 1. display

This defines a flex container where are of its children will follow the rules of a flex based parent.

Lets consider the given html file, as it be seen the container class is defined and it has three children and the container here can be a flex container once its display property changes to `flex`.

```html
<body>
	<main>
		<!-- container -->
		<div class="container">
			<!-- Children -->
			<div class="box box-1">item-1</div>
			<div class="box box-2">item-2</div>
			<div class="box box-3">item-3</div>
		</div>
	</main>
</body>
```

```css
.container {
	display: flex;
}
```

If the display is not flex, how will it look?
