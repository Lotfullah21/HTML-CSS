# `line-height = line-height * font-size`.

# inline and block elements

1. ### Block

block level elements take the full width.
it respects width, height, margin in all directions

2. ### Inline

it takes the width of its contents.
it respects margin in left and right directions only, not the height and width, neither the margin top and bottom.
to center an inline element, we can use `text-align:center` property in its center.

for `block` level elements, we need to specify the width and use `margin:0 auto` property.

3. ### Inline block
   it does not start a new line, but respect all the properties that is respected block elements.
