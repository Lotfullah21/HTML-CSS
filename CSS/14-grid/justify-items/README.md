## Justify-items

when we use content, each div is considered as a single block or grid.

now if we want move the div along that one single column and row (0,0), we use `justify-items` to put the div in the center of that column (0,0).

each grid is consist of (row, column), now these columns and rows can be more.

but the whole idea is we are moving the item around a single grid.

## justify-self:

if we want to move individual elements along the main axi of each grid, we use justify self.
