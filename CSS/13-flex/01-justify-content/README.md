# Justify Content:

The justify-content property is used to align the entire flex items along the main axis

Using this property, container items can be aligned along the main axis. It helps to distribute the leftover spaces. The free spaces will be created when either all of the elements are inflexible and reached to their maximum size or flexible but also have reached their maximum size.

It can take the following values:

`Note`: `Justify-items` are used in grid type containers.

-`justify-content:flex-start`: Items are placed at the beginning of the container.
