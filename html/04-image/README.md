# <img>

The `<img>` tag in HTML is used to create a place holder for the image on the webpage.
It embeds images into a web page.

- <img> is the opening tag for the image element.
- src is an attribute that specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the image file. It can be an absolute URL (e.g., "https://example.com/image.jpg") or a relative URL (e.g., "image.jpg"). This attribute is required which means without it, nothing will be displayed.

- alt is an attribute that provides alternative text for the image.
- It's displayed in place of the image if the image file cannot be loaded or if the user is using a screen reader. It's also used by search engines for indexing. This attribute is optional but recommended for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.

We can also specify additional attributes within the <img> tag, such as width and height, to control the size of the image:
