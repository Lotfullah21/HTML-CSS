#### <!DOCTYPE html>

The first element in an HTML document is the DOCTYPE declaration which notifies the web browser that it is an HTML document.

#### tags and elements:

a tag is the markup syntax used to define elements, while an element consists of the opening tag, content, and closing tag, and represents a specific piece of content within the HTML document.

#### Markup:

"Markup" refers to the process of annotating text to give it meaning, structure, or formatting.

#### DIV:

A `<div>` tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.

#### Attribute:

In HTML, an "attribute" is additional information that can be added to an HTML element to provide extra details about the element or to modify its behavior.

```bash
<tagname attribute_name="attribute_value">Content</tagname>
<h1 class="heading-1">Content</h1>
```

- <tagname> is the HTML element.
- attribute_name is the name of the attribute.
- attribute_value is the value assigned to the attribute.

```bash
<img src="kids.jpeg" alt="kids">
```

- <img> is the HTML element.
- src is the name of the attribute.
- kids.jpeg is the value assigned to the attribute.

Same goes with alt attribute.
